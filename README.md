# coding_challenge

## Overview
This coding challenge is meant to test problem solving, execution, communication, and documentation.  Software building and designing is more of an art than just a skill so be creatvie and have fun.




## Challenge Statement
Build a simple web form that ingests the `data.tsv` file in this repo.  Don't worry about the presentation, it simply has to work.  You can use any language or framework you are comfortable with.  The following requirements are needed for a successful completion:


- Web Application that uploads the `data.tsv`
- Backend persistent system to hold the data (ie. mysql, sql-server, postgress)
- Based on the records in the file calcalute and display to the user the Total Revenue for the records
  - Item Revenue is `item_price * item_count` so a Total would need to be generated and displayed
  - For the given `data.tsv` the total should be `$114802.93`(use this to verify)
- There are 100 records in the data file so you should have 100 records in your backend(FYI,there is a header in the file)
- Handle errors gracefully
- User should have the ability to upload multiple times so provide some page navigation to do so
- You should document everything needed to build your project from scratch(include with the project ie. README).  Assume you are handing this over to someone new so they need all the information to build your entire project(web app, backend, libraries, etc.) and the steps to execute.
- Project and be packaged and emailed, or just use [Github](https://github.com) and share.
- Have fun!




## Summary
This test is meant to test problem solving, creativity, and documentation.  Don't spend more than a couple of hours.  This isn't a pass or fail test we just want to see how our tackle problems and your level of detail.
